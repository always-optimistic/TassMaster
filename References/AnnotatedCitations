This is a PDF I found on the internet that provides useful background information that is relevant to hobbyists building Tass stimulators.
LESSONS: 1) The exact location of the stimulator is not critical as the "receptive fields" of Pacinian corpuscles are large. 2) The stimulators should generate light surface vibration and NOT be pressed firmly into the skin.
